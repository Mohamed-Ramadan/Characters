## How to run this project:
 * 1- clone the repository
 * 2- go to the project directory
 * 3- open .xcodeproj file using XCode 


## - What parts of the test did you find challenging and why?
    * Every part of the test was challenging, starting from establishing the project architecture with clean code, creating the 'Data layer' that is responsible for fetching remote data, then applying the 'Repository Pattern' to be responsible for providing the data to the 'Domain layer'
    * The Design was exciting and challenging also, I used to draw similar designs using the UIkit view component, but I decided to do this test with a new way by creating the shown layout with SwiftUI.
    
## - What feature would you like to add to improve the project?
    * I have many things to add to this project but due to the lack of time and being so busy this day I didn't have the time to apply them I'll do it if I have a free time later ex:
        - Apply Data Cashing using the Local Data layer
        - Add more test coverage
        - maybe enhance the presentation layer so it can be easier to maintain and test
